0,"Been wondering about my Ford Explorer 2018. I took it to the dealer and they said no way to change it. In my vehicle, the doors lock when gear is engaged. If I stop the car while engine running I have to hit ‚Äòunlock‚Äô to let people out of the back whether in park or not. They cannot use the door handle to open the door. They would have to unlock the tiny stem to open the door. It is very frustrating. I want the doors to unlock when in park. It is a really bad set of choices for the consumer and I even dangerous in an accident if the rear passengers need to get out without driver intervention.",UgwMvD2MQKmbwEPu1a14AaABAg,0,0

What kind of nonsense engineers‚Äô engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn‚Äôt safety. It‚Äôs annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let‚Äôs fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don‚Äôt i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights. The push button start is dumb and now every company does it. FN stop it.

When moving it goes to 10 degress.. outside temperature is 40 degree celcius. I have compared to other ford cars. They blow 7 degree air while moving in peak summers. While my car gives 10. Difference in cooling is clearly felt. My vent temperature keeps on fluctuating up and down. While friends ford vent temperature remains absolutely stable 

I got it checked from authorised service of ford. They changed fan motor. But still problems there. I am fed up. Kindly help. I am from india. No one here is having clue.
