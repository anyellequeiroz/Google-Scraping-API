154,"As retired Ford technician, Ford did offer this, probably in a different form over 20 years ago, you could identify the cars from far away, from the yellow band around the perimeter of the window, and the orange, reddish, copper light tint at the window gave off, if you got a stone chip in your window it would break the circuit and the feature would not work, and insurance wouldn't pay for it. In the early 1990s a windshield could cost $2,200 for typical Town Car. Maybe today's technology has made it cheaper and more economical.",UgxzbmrDAR3uJnU3all4AaABAg,12,88

On the way to work it was really annoying because I came with a cold car in a warmer region with more humidity and then the windshield froze over and over again.
For this reason, I have retrofitted the heated windshield and my 2006 Fiesta ST has it too.
