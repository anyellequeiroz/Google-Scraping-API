"Been wondering about my Ford Explorer 2018. I took it to the dealer and they said no way to change it. In my vehicle, the doors lock when gear is engaged. If I stop the car while engine running I have to hit ‘unlock’ to let people out of the back whether in park or not. They cannot use the door handle to open the door. They would have to unlock the tiny stem to open the door. It is very frustrating. I want the doors to unlock when in park. It is a really bad set of choices for the consumer and I even dangerous in an accident if the rear passengers need to get out without driver intervention.",UgwMvD2MQKmbwEPu1a14AaABAg,0,0

"Yeah I have a question. Did you guys ever ask anyone that buys your cars their opinion on this type of In-n-Out secret menu bs?

What kind of nonsense engineers’ engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn’t safety. It’s annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let’s fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don’t i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights. The push button start is dumb and now every company does it. FN stop it.

What kind of nonsense engineers’ engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn’t safety. It’s annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let’s fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don’t i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights.

"Yeah I have a question. Did you guys ever ask anyone that buys your cars their opinion on this type of In-n-Out secret menu bs?

What kind of nonsense engineers’ engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn’t safety. It’s annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let’s fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don’t i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights. The push button start is dumb and now every company does it. FN stop it.

"I really wish the simple function of putting the gear selector in ""Park"" opened all doors like in every other manufacturers' vehicles.  My wife's 2020 Ford Expedition only has two options for auto-unlocking doors: On (Park + Open Driver's Door) or Off.  My Honda Pilot has these options:  On (1. Park + Open Driver's Door or 2. Park) or Off.  Also, there are more options for Auto-Lock (""at speed"" or gear selector moved to Drive).  The Expedition is amazing and WAY better than a Pilot.  No comparison.

"Yeah I have a question. Did you guys ever ask anyone that buys your cars their opinion on this type of In-n-Out secret menu bs?

What kind of nonsense engineers’ engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn’t safety. It’s annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let’s fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don’t i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights. The push button start is dumb and now every company does it. FN stop it.

What kind of nonsense engineers’ engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn’t safety. It’s annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let’s fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don’t i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights.

"Yeah I have a question. Did you guys ever ask anyone that buys your cars their opinion on this type of In-n-Out secret menu bs?

What kind of nonsense engineers’ engineering is this, put the options for it on a menu called security on the ridiculous screens we find in every car now. Also how much influence does hey-ma-look-what i-can-do demographic sway your decisions? Seriously? In all seriousness, this isn’t safety. It’s annoying, locks are in most cases not high quality products, so you decided let’s fix that by adding in layers of automation that to turn off requires an ever increasing level if seat belt insertion extraction dexterity. How about you stop leaving a giant gap between the ignition and the plastic that surrounds it so that one can easily slip their keys into their designated spot without having to put eyes on it at all. Push button start is also super dumb, why don’t i have a fuel cut off switch as well? I wanna feel like a race car driver when I start my pleasant family sedan. Why not an aero toggle that sends power to the magnetos before starting and a fake can of nitrous would be cool too, actually scratch the can I just want a scuba style valve top to eff around with like a fidget spinner before someone in a late 90s caravan wants to have a go at the next set of lights. The push button start is dumb and now every company does it. FN stop it.

"As retired Ford technician, Ford did offer this, probably in a different form over 20 years ago, you could identify the cars from far away, from the yellow band around the perimeter of the window, and the orange, reddish, copper light tint at the window gave off, if you got a stone chip in your window it would break the circuit and the feature would not work, and insurance wouldn't pay for it. In the early 1990s a windshield could cost $2,200 for typical Town Car. Maybe today's technology has made it cheaper and more economical.",UgxzbmrDAR3uJnU3all4AaABAg,12,88

"I live in a fairly cold valley near a mill pond and on my first Fiesta MK3 I had to scrape every day in winter.
On the way to work it was really annoying because I came with a cold car in a warmer region with more humidity and then the windshield froze over and over again.
For this reason, I have retrofitted the heated windshield and my 2006 Fiesta ST has it too.
